\section{Evaluation}
\label{section:evaluation}

\subsection*{Semi-local algorithms}
Show perfomance between lcs and semi-local lcs??? and poor perfomance of recursive algorithm based on steady ant?

\subsection*{Approximate matching algorithms}
Show outperforming for different cases between luciv and our algorithm.

Show quality betwee our new algo and  luciv algo (our should be better)

Show that sparse table bad when large?
