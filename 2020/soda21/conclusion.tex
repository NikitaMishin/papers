\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

Although presented algorithms have a good running time and space complexity, there is unclear how would they behave in practice.
Algorithms are heavily based on \emph{semi-local sa}, thus
there are also need to provide an empirical evaluation of 
algorithms that solve \emph{semi-local sa}.
Also, the research question arises about hidden constants of used data structures and algorithms itself.  

Thus, the following research questions have not been settled in this paper and require further study.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does improved algorithm \ref{alg:patternMathing1} performs better then \cite{luciv2019interactive}  in pracite?
\item What hidden constant of described algorithms and how well they perform in practise?
\item How well performs algorithm for \emph{semi-local sa} in practice?
\end{enumerate}
