\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

In the paper, several new algorithms solving the approximate pattern matching problem are presented.
The presented algorithms also support length constraints on the resulting substrings.
Although presented algorithms have a good running time and space complexity, there is unclear how would they behave in practice.
Algorithms are heavily based on \emph{semi-local sa}, thus there are also need to provide an empirical evaluation of algorithms that solve \emph{semi-local sa}.
Also, the research question arises about hidden constants of used data structures and algorithms itself.  

%% Thus, the following research questions have not been settled in this paper and require further study.
%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item Does improved algorithm~\ref{alg:patternMathing1} performs better then~\cite{luciv2019interactive} in practice?
%% \item What hidden constant of described algorithms and how well they perform in practise?
%% \item How well perform algorithms for \emph{semi-local sa} in practice?
%% \end{enumerate}
