\subsection{Approximate pattern matching}
The approximate pattern matching problem ($AMatch$) defined as follows.
Given text $t$, pattern $p$ and some threshold $h$ the \emph{approximate pattern matching} problem ask for all substrings from text $t$ that have similarity score  with given pattern $p$ at least $h$ according to some similarity function $g$.  

There exist different kinds of extension and particular cases of this problem.
For example, \emph{complete approximate pattern matching} (\emph{CompleteMatch}) that ask for
substrings of text $t$ that are exact clones of pattern $p$.
The approach for this special case of \emph{AMatch} is usage of well-know  algorithms such as  Aho-Korasic, BouerMurr, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, and so on.
The latter one have optimal running time complexity of $O(|p|+|t|)$ for \emph{CompleteMatch} problem.
\emph{Approximate pattern matching with k mismatches} is an another example of special case.



 
The search of \emph{pattern with wildcard symbols} of set of patterns in text $t$, are examples of such extension.





There exist differenct approach for solving \emph{AMatch}
