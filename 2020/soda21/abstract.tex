\begin{abstract}
We present an application of semi-local lcs to approximate string matching by developing a new algorithm and improving the existing one.
Our result is based on the utilization of the underlying algebraic structure of semi-local lcs with the usage of the novel data structure for submatrix maximum queries in Monge matrices.
This gives two algorithms with the following running time and space complexity.
TODO.   
The improvement of the existing algorithm not only preserves all properties but also outperforms in practice.

In addition, we show that the algorithm for semi-local lcs based on sticky braid multiplication is not perform well with the current complex recursive structure.
