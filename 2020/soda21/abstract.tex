\begin{abstract}
  In the paper we study an application of semi-local sa to approximate string matching problem.
  We both developed two new algorithms as well as
  improved the existing near dupplicate search arlogorithm~\cite{Luciv}.
  The key idea behind the algorithms is a usage of the underlying algebraic structure of semi-local lcs~\cite{}
  toogether with a novel data structure for submatrix maximum queries in Monge matrices~\cite{}.
  We show that the presented algorithms running time and space complexity is ... respectively.
  We also show that the improved near dupplicate search arlogorithm not only preserves all properties
  but also outperforms in practice.
  Additionally, we show that sticky braid multiplication based semi-local lcs algorithm~\cite{}
  does not perform well in practrice beacause of its complex recursive structure.
