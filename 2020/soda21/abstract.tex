\begin{abstract}
  In the paper we study an application of semi-local sequence alignment algorithms
  to approximate pattern matching problem.
  We both developed two new algorithms as well as
  improved the existing near dupplicate search arlogorithm~\cite{Luciv}.
  The key idea behind the algorithms is a usage of the underlying algebraic structure of semi-local lcs~\cite{}
  toogether with a novel data structure for submatrix maximum queries in Monge matrices~\cite{}.
  We show that the presented algorithms running time and space complexity is ... respectively.
  We also show that the improved near dupplicate search arlogorithm not only has a better complexity
  but also preserves all declared properties.
  Additionally, we show that sticky braid multiplication based semi-local lcs algorithm~\cite{}
  does not perform well in practrice beacause of its complex recursive structure.
